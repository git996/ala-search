## About 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.5.

### Prerequisites
If running locally, an installation of NodeJS and NPM is required. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Run `npm i ` on the root directory to get all the required node modules. 

If you require a global installation of Angular CLI to run the steps below, run `npm i -g @angular/cli` to add Angular CLI to your system's gloabl node environment. 

### Design
Due to my current familiarity with the Angular framework and its ease of integration with Google's Material UI library, I decided to use the Angular framework for this this application. Time constrains was another factor which lead me to utilize a familiar framework to solve this problem. If a small application with similar requirement to this one was to be developed for production usage, Angular would not be my first choice for a web framework due to its comparatively large overhead more suited for large scale multi-page applications and a steep learning curve. 

### Styling
Google's [Material](https://material.io/) styling implementation for [Angular](https://material.angular.io/guide/customizing-component-styles) has been used for general UI components which allows for just the imported components are packaged with the build. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
